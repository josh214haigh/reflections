When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Several reasons, the most obvious is to allow others to collaborate on your work using a central repo that they can all access.
Another is to allow you to easily work from several computers depending on where you are without transferring the files
across each time you change computer. The most basic reason is to give yourself a backup in case of computer breakdown or hard drive crashes.
